Private charters in most European locations depart and arrive at their own private terminals called General Aviation Terminals therefore you can expect a fast-track service with no delays and with no queuing or waiting. Although your aircraft will not leave without you on board it is worth noting that all flights are pre-booked with Eurocontrol so delaying arriving at the airport might result in a loss of permission to fly which might delay your takeoff time if the pre-booked take off slot is lost.</p>

                        <h2>Getting Familiar with the Cabin</h2>
                        <p>After clearing passport control and once you are escorted to your aircraft you will be greeted by our crew which will explain all the details about your upcoming flight, will explain how to use the gadgets and features of the aircraft and will explain the safety and evacuation protocol and ensure you are comfortable and ready to enjoy the flight.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Will my friends and family know where I am in the air?</h2>
                        <p>Absolutely. During the confirmation of your booking, you will know in advance the tail number of the aircraft which will be carrying out the mission of taking you where you need to be. That tail number can be tracked in real time on sites like flightradar or flightaware. Therefore, if you provide that tail number to your loved ones they will know where you are in the air and how near you to land at your destination therefore making possible pickups by loved one‚Äôs smoother and more efficient. Ask our clients services and they will be more than happy to assist you.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>Don‚Äôt be shy! Let us know what you like to eat, what kind of diet you might be following, what kind of coffee or tea you might like, and our ground staff will make sure we have it all loaded before your flight.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h2>Let us know if you need Wi-Fi during the flight!</h2>
                        <p>The majority of the PC12 aircraft on the Fly7 network have a Wi-Fi enabled module which allows our passengers to check emails, use whatsapp or other chatting apps and perform basic internet web browsing. <br><br> 
                        It would be fair to say that Wi-Fi in the air is not yet so fast as it is on land so do not expect that you will be downloading movies while flying. This is not a limitation of our Wi-Fi modules it is a general limitation of Wi-Fi in the air.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Is it a special occasion, let us know and we will make the preparations!</h2>
                        <p>If you are booking a charter for a special occasion like an anniversary or a birthday, please let our client services know beforehand and we can agree to prepare something special for your special someone. That will make the smile even wider.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Do you have flight fear or are you afraid of turbulence!</h2>
                        <p>People with fear of flying or fear of turbulence can feel free to discuss this with client services and we would very happily book a session before the flight with one of our Pilots which will explain some basic things about flying which we ensure will make anyone with flight fear feel much, much more confident, and comfortable. For extreme cases of flight fear we can suggest some courses which can be taken which have proven to help people overcome the fear and enjoy flying. We have very deep experience in dealing with cases of flight fear so do not hesitate to discuss this with us.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Carrying a pet? It will be right next to you all the flight!</h2>
                        <p>In the Pilatus PC-12 your pet regardless of weight can be in the cabin with you. Your pet will need to be in an EASA approved cage for safety reasons however he will be sitting right next to you where he will be able to see you and interact with you. This is not the case with commercial flights. Pets in commercial carriers are allowed in the cabin when they are less than 9kg (20 Pounds). When pets are larger they usually go to a special compartment which is pressurized right next to the luggage area. <br><br>
                        In our flights you have full access to all your luggage, your belongings and of course your pets during all the flight.</p>
