                        <h3>The OH-DOG</h3>
                        <p>OH-DOG (Tail-Number) our flagship PC12 NGX is 1 of 52 of the PC12 under the Fly7 chartering umbrella. As an aircraft it is owned by a private individual which also happens to be a private pilot. The owner flies OH-DOG together with his Captain for his private needs and when the owner is not flying the aircraft his captain which is trained and type-rated by Fly7 together with a crew operate OH-DOG to serve chartering requests. 

                        <br><br>

                        The owner of OH-DOG has decided on the livery (paintwork) he likes and has also decided on the interior features based on his experience.

                        <br><br>

                        Finally based on his needs the owner of OH-DOG found that the perfect equilibrium of both serving his needs and extending the aircraft for chartering on the Fly7 network is to have OH-DOG stationed in Pafos Airport in Cyprus.</p>

                        <h3>Why own a Pilatus PC12 and <br> not any other Aircraft?</h3>
                        <p>Pilatus is the only Swiss Aircraft Manufacturer. Since 1939 Pilatus has been designing aircraft which have carried the legendary “Crafted in Switzerland” sign and has never stopped innovating. 
                        <br><br>
                        The PC12 has been often called the Swiss Army Knife of the Sky and its nickname does not come out of coincidence as Pilatus has managed to tick so many boxes and fit them all in one majestic machine that has been serving business, pleasure, cargo, military, and medivac operations equally well. As of November 2021, 2137 Pilatus PC12 have been produced and have left the Buochs airport at the foothills of Mount Pilatus to their new home.</p>
                        <br><br>

                        <h4>Engineered like no other</h4>
                        <p>Crafted in Switzerland, engineered like no other. Serving business, pleasure, cargo, military and medivac operations.</p>
                        <br><br>

                        <h4>Cabin Comfort designed by DNA and BMW</h4>
                        <p>Every detail in the cabin of a PC12 has been so well thought. Fine European leather, custom stitching, seats inspired by DNA and BMW, charging docks for all your gadgets, working space for businesspeople on the move, latest Wi-Fi technology. Seats that can switch to fully reclining beds, enough luggage space to not worry about space and the list goes on.</p>
                        <br><br>

                        <h4>Unmatched Safety</h4>
                        <p>Swiss Precision, Swiss Pride and over seven million flight hours behind the ultra-reliable Pratt and Whitney PT6 engine powering a PC12 are enough reasons to be called Proven and Safe.</p>
                        <br><br>

                        <h4>Versatile offering Countless Choices and Destinations</h4>
                        <p>A Pilatus PC12 has the flexibility to be a business jet, a leisure jet, an air ambulance, a cargo operations jet and at the same time land in just 758 meters of runway making it a machine that can perform where others cannot. It can simply do it all and do it well.</p>

                        <h4>Cargo Door</h4>
                        <p>The Pilatus PC12 is fitted with a unique cargo door measuring 1.3M X 1.2M which makes loading cargo, golf equipment, ski equipment, baggage, and large pets easier, trouble free and fast. So either you are a traveller, a golfer, a snowboarder, an animal lover or you just like travelling heavy we have you covered.</p>
                        <br><br>

                        <h4>Unrivalled Efficiency</h4>
                        <p>The whole concept behind the PC12 is to travel faster, on less fuel and most importantly on lower carbon emissions. This makes it both a greener aircraft and a more affordable aircraft to charter and a machine that will get where you need to be on time, every time.</p>
                        <br><br>

                        <h4>Range and Landing Requirements</h4>
                        <p>The Pilatus PC12 has a realistic range of around 1740 Nautical Miles (3220 KM) which is taking into consideration 2 Pilots and 4 Passengers and needs a runway no longer than 758 Meters to land you where you need. These unheard figures make it unbeatable, unreachable, and un-rivaled compared to any other aircraft which has what a PC12 has to offer.</p>
