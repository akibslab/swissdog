                                    <p>Swissdog was founded by our Chief pilot George A. Koumis and one of his students which also happens to be a pilot today. <br> <br>
                                        George dreamed of being a pilot all his life and managed to complete the first step of his dream at the age of 17 by acquiring a private pilot‚Äôs license before he even had a car driving license. The urge of a deeper understanding of aviation, pushed him to go the extra mile and pursue a degree in aeronautical engineering while at the same time challenging himself by double majoring at Oxford Aviation Academy for a commercial pilot‚Äôs license.</p>

                                    <p>By the time George had completed his engineering degree he was also ready to join the airlines as a commercial pilot and fulfill his dream of becoming a complete aviator by not only acquiring flying skills but by also gaining a deep understanding of aviation engineering. The beginning of his career started on the Airbus as a first officer. During his time off from the airlines George taught younger aviators how to fly as a personal hobby. <br>
                                        Over the years to come, George moved on to become a Captain on the Airbus but never gave up teaching a few selected students per year.</p>

                                    <p>n 2018, a childhood friend approached him and explained that he is suffering from severe flight fear, and this has been creating problems to his mental health as his business relied on him to fly overseas. Before every business trip, the idea of flying needed a lot of mental brainwork which resulted in flying only specific airlines, only specific routes, only specific times which had been perceived to be safer, less turbulent, or more comfortable. After a very long discussion, George‚Äôs advice was that he needed to understand more about flying, potentially take control and understand how an airplane flies and overcome this fear based on knowledge. At the end of that year the gentleman which was experiencing severe flight fear registered for flying lessons under the mentoring of George. <br> <br>
                                    That gentleman ended up being a proud owner of a Cirrus SR20 trainer aircraft which he felt was the best choice as a platform to learn how to fly mainly due to the existence of a parachute system which gave him more comfort. The start was severely hard, for both George and for his new student and whenever George had time off from his airline duty, they spent time learning both on the ground and in the air. </p>

                                    <p>After 2.5 years the student decided the Cirrus SR20 aircraft was not enough anymore. He was ready for something bigger, something faster, something that he could fly on his own to get to where he needs to be. After test flying several aircraft George and his student decided that his next step should be a Pilatus PC12.  That day Swissdog was born without anybody realizing. Instructor and Student had just started a venture without realizing. They found themselves in possession of a PC12 NGX registered under tail number OH-DOG which realistically could not be flown enough hours by George and his student. The aircraft would remain under-utilized by just flying as a private plane for George and his student.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    A decision that day was made. OH-DOG, the flagship aircraft of Swissdog as we know it today, would be made available for chartering. The next logical decision was that OH-DOG could not be a standalone aircraft available for chartering and that it would be most beneficial that it joined a network that could support it. And that network was Fly7. This is our unique story in brief. OH-DOG the flagship PC12 NGX of Swissdog is today a part of the largest PC12 operation in the world proudly serving customer across Europe and the Middle East along with another 51 PC12 aircraft.</p>
